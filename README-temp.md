## Details

### astro

[WIP]

- ‚ùå uses missing features
  - uses `meta.chunks` in `renderChunk` hook, also does `delete chunk.modules[id]`
    - https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/46ec06ed82887eaf1fe3a73158407b496669c5f0/packages/astro/src/core/build/plugins/plugin-css.ts#L172-L175
- ‚ùå many tests failing
  - TODO: need to investigate further

### marko

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Errors because it tries to update `input` option in `buildStart`
  - Added a patch to update `input` option in `options` hook
- ‚úÖ passed by converting esbuild plugins to rollup plugins

### nuxt

- ‚ö†Ô∏è uses function type `outputOptions.assetFileNames` in `generateBundle` hook
  - it can be workaround by using `this.environment.config.build.rollupOptions.output.assetFileNames` (applied this workaround)
  - [rolldown/rolldown#3445](https://github.com/rolldown/rolldown/issues/3445)

### qwik

- ‚ö†Ô∏è uses missing features
  - `manualChunks`
    - wants to group chunks by entry ([code](https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/blob/0a752dc6dd4c7b0000aa6a1d17f3ccfcee89fc7f/packages/qwik/src/optimizer/src/plugins/plugin.ts#L873-L880), introduced in [QwikDev/qwik#6670](https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/pull/6670), related issue [rollup/rollup#5574](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5574))
  - `preserveSignature` option in `this.emitFile({ type: 'chunk' })`
    - [rolldown/rolldown#3500](https://github.com/rolldown/rolldown/issues/3500)
- ‚úÖ `pnpm tsx --require ./scripts/runBefore.ts starters/dev-server.ts 3301` hanged
  - added a fix, probably because there was a dead-lock

### sveltekit

better to run with `CI=1` as some tests are flaky and setting that will retry them

- ‚ö†Ô∏è uses `manualChunks` but can be replaced with `advancedChunks`
  - Note that the test expects a single chunk to be output, but rolldown outputs 5 chunks (probably because it'll break the execution order), ~~I guess this is fine~~ maybe not (https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/3882), it seems they want to make sure there's a single chunk
  - Also found some issue with `experimental.strictExecutionOrder`: https://github.com/rolldown/rolldown/issues/3410
- ‚úÖ tests in `apps/dev-only`
  - passed by converting esbuild plugins to rollup plugins

### unocss

- ‚ùå `test/fixtures.test.ts > fixtures > vite client`/`test/fixtures.test.ts > fixtures > vite lib`/`test/fixtures.test.ts > fixtures > vite lib rollupOptions` fails
  - UnoCSS modifies `chunk.modules` to fool the css plugin to generate the css in corresponding chunk ([unocss/unocss#4403](https://github.com/unocss/unocss/issues/4403))

### vike

- uses missing features
  - ‚ùå uses `manualChunks` that requires callbacks
    - https://github.com/vikejs/vike/blob/ea3a84264222768b9869e5f87ce4429e0685f3ae/vike/node/plugin/plugins/distFileNames.ts#L45-L101
    - introduced to workaround [vikejs/vike#1815](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/1815)
    - maybe this can be workaround by adding `?url` to all CSS imports
- ‚ùå `|e2e| test/preload/prod.spec.ts` fails
  - because `manualChunks` is not supported

### vite-plugin-svelte

- ‚ö†Ô∏è `pnpm test:build`
  - `packages/e2e-tests/kit-node/__tests__/kit.spec.ts > kit-node > index route > should not include dynamic import from onmount in ssr output`
    - caused by https://github.com/rolldown/rolldown/issues/3403
- ‚úÖ `pnpm test:serve`
  - passed by converting esbuild plugins to rollup plugins

### vite-plugin-vue

The failing tests are

- ‚ö†Ô∏è `playground/vue-lib/__tests__/vue-lib.spec.ts` > `vue component library > should output tree shakeable css module code`
  - This is happening because OXC minifier does not drop non-used variables
- ‚úÖ `playground/vue-legacy/__tests__/vue-legacy.spec.ts`
  - This is expected as rolldown-vite currently does not support the legacy plugin

### waku

needs `VITE_USE_LEGACY_PARSE_AST=1` (waiting for https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/pull/8983, released in OXC 0.50.0)

make sure to run with `BROWSER=chromium` if you have a different value set to `BROWSER`

- ‚ö†Ô∏è uses `preserveEntrySignatures: 'exports-only'`
  - [rolldown/rolldown#3500](https://github.com/rolldown/rolldown/issues/3500)
